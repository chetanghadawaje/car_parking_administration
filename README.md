Scenario 

You are part of a team at Data Axle that is tasked with building a system for Car Parking administration.



Task

Your task is to implement a small part of business logic along with associated test cases that verify that the logic works according to the use cases below



Use Cases 

The two following use cases should be implemented.

The end-user should use phone numbers/email to sign up.
End-user should see all available parking spots lant and long values.
End-user should search for an address and find a nearby parking spot. (input: lat, long, radius in meters. Output - list of parking spots within the radius).
for example, if the user searches for Orchid Baner and specifies range at 1000 meters then he should see only parking spots in the range of 1000 meters, not the parking spots that are in Viman Negar as that will be more than 1000metrs away
The end-user should reserve a parking spot by providing a number of hours as an upfront commitment, he should be shown the price he will need to pay.
The end-user should be able to view his existing reservations
